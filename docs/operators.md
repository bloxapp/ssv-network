## Registering an operator
The function `SSVNetwork.registerOperator()` is used to register a validator.
Input parameters:
`publicKey`: The public key of the operator
`fee`: Should be `0` or greater than `100000000` and less than the value returned by `SSVNetworkViews.getMaximumOperatorFee()`

After the operator is registered, the caller becomes the `owner`, the `fee` is set and the `whitelisted` status is set to `false`.
The `whitelisted` flag of the operator indicates if the operator is private (when set to `true`) or public (`false`),

## Whitelisted operators
An operator owner can restrict the usage of it to specific EOAs, generic contracts and whitelisting contracts. 
A whitelisting contract is the one that implements the [ISSVWhitelistingContract](../contracts/interfaces/external/ISSVWhitelistingContract.sol) interface.

The restriction is only effective when the operator owner sets the privacy status of the operator to *private*.

To manage the whitelisted addresses, these 2 data structures are used:

`mapping(uint64 => address) operatorsWhitelist`: Keeps the relation between an operator and a whitelisting contract.
`mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) addressWhitelistedForOperators`: Links an address (EOA/generic contract) ot a list of operators identified by its `operatorId` using bitmaps.

### What is a Whitelisting Contract?
The operators can choose to whitelist an external contract with custom logic to manage authorized addresses externally. To be used in SSV contracts, it needs to implement the [ISSVWhitelistingContract](../contracts/interfaces/external/ISSVWhitelistingContract.sol) interface, that requires to implement the `isWhitelisted(address account, uint256 operatorId)` function. This function is called in the register validator process, that must return `true/false` to indicate if the caller (`msg.sender`) is whitelisted for the operator.

It's up to the implementation of the whitelisting contract to use the `operatorId` parameter in the `isWhitelisted` function.

To check if a contact is a valid whitelisting contract, use the function `SSVNetworkViews.isWhitelistingContract(address contractAddress)`.

To check if an account is whitelisted in a whitelisting contract, use the function `SSVNetworkViews.isAddressWhitelistedInWhitelistingContract(address account, uint256 operatorId, address whitelistingContract)`.

### Legacy whitelisted addresses transition process
Up until v1.1.1, operators use the `operatorsWhitelist` mapping to save EOAs and generic contracts. Now in v1.2.0, those type of addresses are stored in `addressWhitelistedForOperators`, leaving `operatorsWhitelist` to save only whitelisting contracts.
When whitelisting a new whitelisting contract, the current address stored in `operatorsWhitelist` will be moved to `addressWhitelistedForOperators`, and the new address stored in `operatorsWhitelist`.
When whitelising a new EOA/generic contract, it will be saved in `addressWhitelistedForOperators`, leaving the previous address in `operatorsWhitelist` intact.

### Operator whitelist states
The following table shows all possible combinations of whitelisted addresses for a given operator.
| Use legacy EOA/generic contract  | Use whitelising contract  | Use EOAs/generic contracts |
|---|---|---|
| Y  |   |   |
| Y  |   | Y  |
|   | Y  |   |
|   |   | Y  |
|   | Y  | Y  |

The operarator status changes to private (`Operator.whitelisted == true`), so only the whitelisted addresses can use the operator's services when the operator owner explicitly sets the *private* status calling `SSVNetwork.setOperatorsPrivateUnchecked()`, no matter if it has whitelisted addresses.

The operarator status changes to public (`Operator.whitelisted == false`), so anyone can use the operator's services when the operator owner explicitly sets the public status calling `SSVNetwork.setOperatorsPublicUnchecked()`, no matter if it still has whitelisted addresses.

### Registering whitelist addresses
Functions related to whitelisting contracts:
- Register: `SSVNetwork.setOperatorsWhitelistingContract(uint64[] calldata operatorIds, ISSVWhitelistingContract whitelistingContract)`
- Remove: `SSVNetwork.removeOperatorsWhitelistingContract(uint64[] calldata operatorIds)`

Functions related to EOAs/generic contracts:
- Register multiple addresses to multiple operators: `SSVNetwork.setOperatorMultipleWhitelists(uint64[] calldata operatorIds, address[] calldata whitelistAddresses)`
- Remove multiple addresses for multiple operators: `SSVNetwork.removeOperatorMultipleWhitelists(uint64[] calldata operatorIds, address[] calldata whitelistAddresses)`

### Registering validators using whitelisted operators
When registering validators using `SSVNetwork.registerValidator` or `SSVNetwork.registerValidator`, the flow to check if the caller is authorized to use a whitelisted operator is the following:
1. Check if the operator is whitelisted via the SSV whitelisting module, using `addressWhitelistedForOperators`.
2. Check if the operator has a whitelisted address in `operatorsWhitelist`.
    1. Check if the caller is the whitelisted address. In this step we keep the whitelisting system backward compatible with previous whitelisted EOAs/generic contracts.
    2. Check if the address is a whitelisting contract. Then call its `isWhitelisted()` function.

If the caller is not authorized for any of the whitelisted operators, the transaction will revert with the `CallerNotWhitelistedWithData(<operatorId>)` error.
